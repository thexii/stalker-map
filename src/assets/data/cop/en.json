The front of the pistol\u2019s barrel is covered with an integrated silencer, while the bolt mechanism is short, which prevents a back-moving spring from being located inside it, and it is therefore situated in the weapon\u2019s handle. Morally obsolete, the weapon is still effective in the right hands.",

  "st_wpn_usp_descr": "Impeccable reliability and durability combined with excellent accuracy are the main noteworthy features of this weapon. Its minor drawbacks include its considerable size, relatively high center of gravity and massive bolt, which make it difficult to conceal but do not outweigh the weapon\u0027s positive features. The weapon is especially popular with the Zone\u0027s veterans.",
  "st_wpn_eagle": "Black Kite",
  "st_wpn_eagle_descr": "The ultimate hand cannon - bulky, heavy and highly lethal. Developed as a specialized weapon for hunting medium-sized and large game, as well as for shooting competitions involving firing at steel body targets at distances over 50 meters. Its limited use in the Zone can be attributed to its price, size and weight, which are all double those of other pistols.",

  "st_wpn_abakan": "AC-96/2",
  "st_wpn_abakan_descr": "A modern assault rifle developed as a replacement for the ageing AKM 74/2. The main difference is its high speed 2-round burst firing mode, which allows two bullets to be fired at exactly the same spot on a target up to 100 meters away.

  "st_wpn_lr300_descr": "A new step in the development of this famous weapon family. The changes were made to the upper half of the steel construction comprising the barrel, gas tube and bolt assembly, reducing the weapon\u2019s weight, improving ergonomics and its gas system.
